Configure an Oracle Cloud Instance Free VM to host small flask / django 
applications.

Build the infrastructure using Terraform. The terraform scripts are mostly the 
example from Oracle, trimmed to drop anything I didn't think I needed. They 
create a single VM, hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), using its 
"always free" tier.


To Do / To Research:

- VM is created and assigned an IP. How do people actually manage DNS with
  these sorts of setups? (Point domain name to load balancer you never touch?)
- The nginx conf file seems goofy. Check out something like nginx-proxy?
- Is there a way for each container to use the same port. It's weird they bind
  on the host. I might be doing something wrong.
- bootstrapping the certs with certbot was goofy, I had to edit the nginx conf
  file. That can't be how people do this.
