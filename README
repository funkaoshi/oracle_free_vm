Configure an Oracle Cloud Instance Free VM to host small flask / django 
applications.

Build the infrastructure using Terraform. The terraform scripts are mostly the 
example from Oracle, trimmed to drop anything I didn't think I needed. They 
create a single VM, hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), using its 
"always free" tier.

TODO:
- VM is created and assigned an IP. Should store that in myhosts, or track it
  in some way that is less goofy.
- Set up a DNS of some sort?
